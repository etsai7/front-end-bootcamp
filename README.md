# Front End Bootcamp

There are four sub-repos under this project:

- `front-end-demos` has demonstrations of plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- `front-end-labs` has labs that use plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- `react-demos` has demonstrations of React code for the React portion of the class
- `react-labs` has exercises for the React portion of the class.

Do not open the root of the repository in your IDE of choice.

## Set up

Each project needs to be set up individually. But the setup is similar for each one:

### For `front-end-demos`, `front-end-labs`, and `react-demos`

- Open the directory in your IDE of choice
- Open a terminal/command prompt
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Run `npm run dev` to start the server associated with the project.

### For `react-labs`

- Open the `react-app` sub-folder in your IDE. **DO NOT** open `react-labs`
  - Nothing bad will happen, but it's going to make your IDE experience confusing
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Run `npm run dev` to start the server associated with the project.
- There are specific instructions to load each lab, which are available in the README for the `react-app` folder.
